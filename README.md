# NIPOCPEC

## Introduction

**NIPOCPEC** is a MATLAB implementation of the proposed **N**on-**I**nterior-**P**oint solution method for the **O**ptimal **C**ontrol **P**roblem with **E**quilibrium **C**onstraints. This Repository holds the source code for the following paper:

1. Kangyu Lin and Toshiyuki Ohtsuka, "A Non-Interior-Point Method for the Optimal Control Problem with Equilibrium Constraints, " 61st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, 2022, (accepted)

2. Kangyu Lin and Toshiyuki Ohtsuka, "A Non-Interior-Point Continuation Method for the Optimal Control Problem with Equilibrium Constraints, " <https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10336>, 2022, (under review)

## Requirements

- MATLAB 2019b or later  
- MATLAB Symbolic Math Toolbox

## Installation

1. Clone or download `NIPOCPEC`.
2. Extract the downloaded file.
3. Open and run `start_NIPOCPEC.m` to add `NIPOCPEC` to your `MATLAB` path

## How to use

See `QuickStart` in `Example`

## Note

A CasADi version (only support `Reg_Scholtes' reformulation) can be founded in <https://github.com/KY-Lin22/NIPOCPEC_CasADi>
